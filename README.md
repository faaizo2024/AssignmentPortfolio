Personal Portfolio Website
Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website created using React. It serves as a platform to showcase my bio, skills, projects, and contact information. Through this project, I aim to reinforce my understanding of React components and CSS styling while creating a practical product that I can use to present myself to potential employers or collaborators.

Components:
Homepage Component: A welcoming page with a brief introduction of myself.
Bio Component: Contains a short biography discussing my background, education, interests, and journey into coding.
Skills Component: Lists the programming languages and tools I am familiar with, using icons or images for a visually appealing presentation.
Projects Component: Showcases previous projects I have worked on, including titles, brief descriptions, and images.
Contact Component: Includes my contact information or a form for visitors to send messages, displaying my email address and LinkedIn profile link.
Guidelines:
Each component is styled to provide a cohesive look and feel across the website, using CSS or any preferred CSS-in-JS library.
Semantic HTML is used within React components for accessibility.
While the focus is primarily on components and styling, I can optionally explore implementing simple navigation between pages using React Router for extra credit.
Deliverables
Source Code: Uploaded to a GitHub repository.
README File: Includes an overview of the project, instructions on how to run it locally, and details on any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
This README provides an overview of the personal portfolio website project, outlining its objectives, requirements, guidelines, and deliverables. It serves as a guide for anyone interested in understanding the project and its implementation.
